= jekyll-testtasks - Test your Jekyll plugins with ease.

== VERSION

This documentation refers to jekyll-testtasks version 0.0.2


== DESCRIPTION

Simplifies testing your Jekyll plugins. Just add this to your Rakefile:

  require 'jekyll/testtasks/rake'

Currently only allows to run Jekyll's original test tasks with your plugin
loaded to make sure you didn't break anything. More to come?

Note that your Jekyll installation needs to be patched in order to run with
your plugin loaded. The necessary patch will be displayed when you try to
run a task against an unpatched installation.

You can point at the Jekyll installation to use by either setting the
environment variable +JEKYLL+ or by creating a file <tt>.jekyll</tt> in
your plugin's project directory with the path in it.
